App to automatically populate pre-written text messages for customer communication while working as an independent contractor for Shipt and Instacart
Built using Tasker v. 5.13.7 with AutoInput. App generated using Tasker App Factory. Project started 2021-10-19.
Requires purchase and use of Texpand Premium (https://www.texpandapp.com/; cost $6.99 as of 2021-10-21). Nonessential app features require Waze and Google Voice.

To install and run, download and install the .apk file. Alternately, import the source code into Tasker and create a shortcut widget on the home screen. Make sure you have AutoInput installed as well if you choose this option.
Then, download and install Texpand Premium. Download and import the Texpand phrases .csv file into Texpand.

App use is hopefully mostly self-explanatory. A few notes:

When starting the app for the first time and whenever starting a new batch of customers, tap the "Reset" button in the Main Order Window first to prevent strange things from happening.

Navigation buttons to stores open in Waze. Buttons for Wegmans and Target are included. Favorite the locations of these (or other) stores in your locale in Waze and name the favorites "Wegmans" and "Target" for this feature to work.

Contact Customers via Google Voice SMS:
I use a Google Voice number with Shipt to keep my customer messages apart from my personal messages in my phone's default SMS app. To use this feature, add all the Shipt relay numbers you have to your phone Contacts list as "Shipt #nn" with the "nn" replaced with a 1- or 2-digit number. Enter this number in the far-right column in the Main Order Window. In the Order Summary window, tap the number to automatically open a new text to the corresponding customer in Google Voice.
