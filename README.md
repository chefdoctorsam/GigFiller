App use is hopefully mostly self-explanatory. A few notes:

When starting the app for the first time and whenever starting a new batch of customers, tap the "Reset" button in the Main Order Window first to prevent strange things from happening.

Contact Customers via Google Voice SMS:
I use a Google Voice number with Shipt to keep my customer messages apart from my personal messages in my phone's default SMS app. To use this feature, add all the Shipt relay numbers you have to your phone Contacts list as "Shipt #nn" with the "nn" replaced with a 1- or 2-digit number. Enter this number in the far-right column in the Main Order Window. In the Order Summary window, tap the number to automatically open a new text to the corresponding customer in Google Voice.
